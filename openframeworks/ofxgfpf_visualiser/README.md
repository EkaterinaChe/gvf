ofxLeapMotion
=============

A wrapper for the Leap SDK ( 0.7 and up )

This is work in progress. 
Updated example includes a simple hand structure which has finger pos, velocity, id and palm position and orientation. 

Notes:
- You will need the Leap.app running while the example runs.
- If you stop getting data coming in to the app it might be that the Leap.app needs restarting ( think this is a Leap issue )
- Will include an example for VS 2010 soon.
